- Exchange processing
  - Currently only LSE

# TODO

- Make a changelog, compare against market news so as to get a verifiable way of interpreting cancellations etc.
  - (which don't appear to be reported in a consistent manner)
  ...so as to be able to update this in response to the market feed 
  (i.e. to predict it from the news text items) rather than wait for the LSE spreadsheet to be updated
- Incorporate more info from Wikipedia/Wikidata beyond ticker symbol matching
  - e.g. classifying/grouping based on Wiki text and tags/links etc. beyond the simple industry label given in companies.tsv
- Add other exchanges (starting with NYSE/NASDAQ) - there are around 60 major global exchanges in total apparently
